I am passionate about using machine learning to unlock meaninful insights. In my current role, I've developed deep-learning-based pipelines to detect, and extract information from, obituaries and marriage announcements in historical newspapers, allowing millions of people to connect with stories about their ancestors. Prior to becoming a data scientist, I was a faculty member in Molecular Biology at Indiana University.
